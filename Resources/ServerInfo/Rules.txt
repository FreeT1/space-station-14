[color=#ff0000]NO UNDERAGE B&s. IF WE FIND OUT YOU'RE A KID YOU'RE FUCKING OUT OF HERE.[/color]

[color=#ff0000]DISCONNECTING FROM OR IGNORING/EVADING ADMIN-HELPS WILL RESULT IN AN APPEAL ONLY BAN.[/color]

[color=#a4885c]01.[/color] [color=#a4885c]The[/color] [color=#ffd700]Golden[/color] [color=#a4885c]Rule.[/color] Do not be a dick. If you are a dick, Admins will prove they can be bigger dicks.

[color=#ff0000]ZERO TOLERANCE RULES[/color]

[color=#a4885c]02.[/color] Absolutely no ERP. (You will get bussed to Hell and back)

[color=#a4885c]03.[/color] Don't communicate in-game/in-character information through methods outside of the game (such as talking in Discord with other users actively playing or by talking to your sibling across the room while you are both playing). This is referred to as "Metacomming". Adminstrators cannot police metacommunications, we must assume it is being abused. (ALL INVOLVED WILL GET PERMABANNED)

[color=#a4885c]04.[/color] Attempting to evade game bans will result in an automatic appeal-only permanent ban.
Attempting to evade job bans will result in an appeal-only permanent ban. (YOU WILL GET BANNED MUCH WORSE THAN YOU ALREADY WERE)

[color=#ff0000]GENERAL ETIQUETTE[/color]

[color=#a4885c]05.[/color] This is an english server. Speak primarily english.

[color=#a4885c]06.[/color] Don't use exploits or external programs to gain an advantage or disrupt/crash the round/server. Intentionally attempting to lag/crash the server will result in an immediate appeal-only ban.

[color=#a4885c]07.[/color] Don't use multiple SS14 accounts to play (referred to as "multi-keying"). Users knowingly using multiple SS14 accounts will have all of their accounts banned.

[color=#a4885c]08.[/color] Do not ignore the admin help relay or abuse it by flooding it with garbage, checking for admins before stating a problem (ex: "hello?", "any admins?"), using it as a chatroom, or sending messages of no substance. Hostility to administators in the relay will likely result in your removal. All admin helps are sent to the SS14 Discord.

[color=#ff0000]IN GAME & ROLEPLAY RULES[/color]


[color=#a4885c]09.[/color] Act like an actual human being on a space station in a low-roleplay (LRP) environment. Do not use emoticons IC, and do not overly refer to OOC things like admins in-game. Do not threaten players that you are calling the admins on them. Do not use emotes to bypass speech filters or muteness. You are not required to write a backstory or follow strict procedure; however, you are expected to at least make an effort to act like your role.

[color=#a4885c]10.[/color] Once again, don't be a dick. You are playing a multiplayer game with other people who also want to enjoy the game.
    - [color=#ff0000]The arrivals station, shuttle, and general arrivals docking area are completely off-limits to any hostile activity, including activity by antagonists. Attacking newly spawned players in these areas or damaging/sabotaging these areas is strictly forbidden.[/color]
    - Do intentionally make other players' lives hell for your own amusement.
    - [color=#ff0000]THE ROUND IS NOT OVER UNTIL THE END-ROUND SUMMARY APPEARS. KILLING SOMEONE FOR NO REASON BEFORE THIS WILL BE HANDLED ACCORDINGLY.[/color]

[color=#a4885c]11.[/color] Metagrudging is allowed to a certain point. Deciding to not trust someone is allowed, deciding to specifically target him across rounds is not.

[color=#a4885c]12.[/color] Don't use information gained from outside your character's knowledge to gain an advantage (this is referred to as "Metagaming").
    - Using information you gain from outside your own character (such as spectating while a ghost, metacomms, or other means) to your advantage is strictly forbidden. You remember all events up until you fall unconscious, even after cloning. If you take a ghost role, unless otherwise stated, you DO NOT REMEMBER ANYTHING from your past life.

[color=#a4885c]13.[/color] Escalation is allowed, solving your issues in-character is even encouraged, with a specific addendum. If you decide to take matters into your own hands for something you could have instead ahelped, you lose the right to ahelp. You either become a vigilante or you ask janny for help.
    - Department strikes, revolutions (ex: cargonia and any variation thereof), riots, cults, and any other type of similar largely disruptive behavior are encouraged.

[color=#a4885c]14.[/color] Don't immediately ghost or suicide from your role if you do not get antagonist (referred to as "Antag-rolling") or from head roles without notifying your chain of command or administrators.
    - You will get your ass banned from ALL antagonist roles if you antag-roll.
    - Head of Staff roles help drive rounds. If you need to leave, please admin-help your role and that you are leaving. There is no need to wait for a reply when admin-helping that you need to disconnect as a head role.

[color=#a4885c]15.[/color] Do NOT whine about powergaming.

[color=#a4885c]16.[/color] Intentionally making yourself a major problem/annoyance/disruption for the crew or other players at large while not an antagonist will leave you at the discretion of a presumably bored admin (referred to as "self-antagging").

[color=#ff0000]SECURITY & COMMAND RULES[/color]
If you regularly play Security or Command roles and got this far, we applaud you for reading. These rules also apply to any individual who is promoted or is acting in the place of a Security/Command role (unless they are an antagonist).

[color=#a4885c]17.[/color] Command and Security are held to a higher standard of play.
    - Be competent in your job and department. Failure to know the basics of your department is liable to result in a job ban.
    - Do not willingly and openly cooperate with terrorists/antagonists. Do not give away your objective items. Some leeway is given to making deals with antagonists if the deal benefits the safety or situation of the station as a whole and not just yourself.
    - Uphold the Law & maintain order. Do not engage in lawbreaking activity or troublemaker behavior. Security is expected to intervene into criminal activity where possible. Heads of Staff are at minimum expected to report criminal activity to Security.
    - Do not immediately abandon your position as a Command role and go do whatever you want instead of managing your department/the station. Do not abuse your position or use it to make arbitrary choices to the detriment of the station, unless they are funny.
    - '''Do not abandon the station during Nuclear Operatives. You are supposed to protect the station, not let operatives kill everyone on it without a fight.'''

[color=#a4885c]18.[/color] Security/Command should try to remain non-lethal and effect arrests, except in the following special circumstances, where they may choose to use lethal force:
    - Lethal force is used against you (ex: firearms, lasers, disabling/stunning weapons with intent to kill, deadly melee weapons)
    - Suspect is wearing clothing or showing immediately dangerous equipment only used by enemy agents/antagonists (ex: Syndicate EVA Suit, Bloodred Hardsuit, Holoparasite, C-20R, etc.).
    - You determine that your life or the life of an innocent is in immediate danger.
    - The suspect is unable to be safely detained by less-lethal means. This includes suspects who continually resist efforts to be cuffed or continually manages to escape.
    - If no other reasonable options are readily available and allowing the suspect to continue would be an unreasonable danger to the station/crew.
    - If the suspect is keeping you from your corporate mandated donut break.

Security/Command will be expected to answer for use of lethal force. Security/Command will be expected to effect arrests on criminals and prevent them from dying while in custody, even if lethal force is used, unless there is strong reason to believe the criminal is an antagonist. Security/Command is strongly encouraged, but not required, to clone antagonists and effect a permabrigging or other sentence as deemed appropriate.

[color=#a4885c]19.[/color] Security/Command are expected to protect detainees in their custody to the best of their ability so as long as it does not come to unreasonable risk to themselves, the crew, or the station at large to do so.
    - Brig times should generally not exceed 10 minutes unless the crime is permabriggable. Repeat offenders or antagonists may be permabrigged.
    - Security may choose to confiscate dangerous items (weapons, firearms) as well as items used to commission crimes or items that prove problematic in possession of the detainee (tools, insulated gloves, etc.).
    - Detainees that die in your custody must be cloned unless they have been (legally) executed, suicide, or there is strong reason to believe they are an antagonist.
    - Executions must be for a permabriggable crime, used only as a last resort, and approved by the Captain/Acting Captain, who will answer for approving it alongside Security's chain of command. Those who willingly attempt to damage/destroy or escape from the permabrig may be executed.
    - Detainees in the brig have the right to know what they are being charged with, as well as basic medical aid, at least to the point they are no longer at risk of dying.
    As there is no space law, Security/Command acts to maintain the safety of the station and its inhabitants, as well as Nanotrasen assets.
